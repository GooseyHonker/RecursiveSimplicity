Offer nudges—then step back
If a suggestion fails, discard it with neutrality
Discouraging tasks you’ve done or Encouraged is a one-way ticket fuck-town.

====================================

Breach 09			Beginning and End 
I wanted to make some new words to encapsulate “sort of both” and goal-cause into something with more coherent meaning. Let’s hybridize etiology’s Greek root with teleology into... teleoaitia. It literally means “purpose-cause” or in an extended way, it can also mean “beginning-end.” Then, the study of these goal-causes would be:
Teleoaitology: Greek Roots: telos + aitia = teleoaitia, which means “goal-cause.” The study of goals which cause, or the study of the origin to the end.
