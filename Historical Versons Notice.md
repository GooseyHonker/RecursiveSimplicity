Do NOT misread old versions:

1. Old repository versions reflect an exploratory draft predating the current framework. It contains provisional content, metaphors, and hypotheses that have since been revised.

2. Keep the Guardrails Visible Don’t bury the warnings, disclaimers, or “read before proceeding” notices—surface them right at the top so anyone encountering the file knows its limits.

3. “Then vs. Now” Context: Earlier drafts spoke more sharply in places; the current model reflects refined language and clarified intent.

4. Anticipate the Emotional Read If something might land as confrontational, briefly acknowledge why:

“Some content in old repository versions were deliberately intense to capture the stakes I felt at the time—they should be read as urgency, not hostility.”
