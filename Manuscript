Acknowledgements
Words alone cannot express the feeling of usefulness I find in my community of books. Floundering in my uncertainty and unawareness, reflective mediums have helped me find my own answers to the deepest questions I didn’t know I was asking.
In the beginning of waking up from my long nightmare, there was Pete Walker and his consistently useful books: Complex PTSD and The Tao of Fully Feeling.
In the middle, when I saw no way up – and life was to be a decent into perpetual suffering – The Courage to be Disliked and The Courage to be Happy, both by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, helped me see a path forward.
And as I reached the end of my long nightmare, Devon Price and his book on Unmasking Autism and Unmasking for Life, simultaneously brought me clarity and forged the philosophical into the tangible.
And through it all were the people who heard my voice and myself in my search for answers, diving deeper and deeper...









“A prayer cannot be born out of those who know nothing but joy. Oh, child of suffering, cursing life itself… Certainly there is something only you can do.” —Akihito Tsukushi, Made in Abyss

Breach 01
Repeat State: Alive/Secure/Exists
I first learned about the existence of etiology and teleology from The Courage to be Disliked, by Kishimi and Koga. The sharp contradiction between etiology and teleology poured over me like ice-cold water. Let’s break them down as a refresher or introduction if you haven’t heard these terms before. Etiology It was world-shifting. But, I had to take a step back and think. Where does thinking, feeling, and doing happen? Easy: the brain. My brain. Your brain. Their brain.
