The Long Nightmare - Acknowledgements
Words alone cannot express the feeling of usefulness I find in my community of books. Floundering in my uncertainty and unawareness, reflective mediums have helped me find my own answers to the deepest questions I didn’t know I was asking.
In the beginning of waking up from my long nightmare, there was Pete Walker and his consistently useful books: Complex PTSD and The Tao of Fully Feeling.
In the middle, when I saw no way up – and life was to be a decent into perpetual suffering – The Courage to be Disliked and The Courage to be Happy, both by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, helped me see a path forward.
And as I reached the end of my long nightmare, Devon Price and his book on Unmasking Autism and Unmasking for Life, simultaneously brought me clarity and forged prior philosophicals into tangibles.
And through it all were the people who heard my voice and saw my self – in my search for answers – diving deeper and deeper...









“A prayer cannot be born out of those who know nothing but joy. Oh, child of suffering, cursing life itself… Certainly there is something only you can do.” —Akihito Tsukushi, Made in Abyss

Dedication
This book is dedicated to all children; small and large, young and old. To the ones who are fibrous, fleshy, furry, scaley, or chitinous. To the valued and devalued. To those loved and those discarded. To the ones that move and the ones that are still. To the visible and invisible, may you all be heard and seen.













Induction






Etiology or Teleology?
I first learned about the existence of etiology and teleology from The Courage to be Disliked, by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. The sharp contradiction between etiology and teleology, as they explained it, poured over me like ice-cold water in the middle of deep sleep, especially after having read Complex PTSD by Pete Walker so recently. Let’s break them down as a refresher or introduce them if you haven’t heard of these terms before. They’re foundational:
Etiology – Greek Root: aitia, which means “cause, responsibility.” The study of causes. The origin. 
Teleology – Greek Root: telos, which means “goal, result.” The study of goals. The end. 
	Do you see how tricky it can be to pick either etiology or teleology as a lens? Are there only causes? Are there only goals? Disorienting, really. So, I had to take a step back and think. To literally think about thinking. Funny right? But seriously, where does thinking, feeling, and doing happen? 
Simple: the brain. My brain. Your brain. Their brain. BRRAAAAAIIIIIINNNNNNZZZZZZ. There’s this guy named Peter Putnam who made this Outline of a Functional Model of the Nervous System in 1963. A very academic hoity-toity piece of work for sure, but he says that the brain is a bunch of correlated neurons.  As much as people love and/or hate their brain, that’s where the thinking, feeling, and doing originate. To see the big end goal of the brain – the teleological end – we kinda have to see where the brain originates – the etiological origin from the perspective of a neuron. 
If the brain is made of a bunch of neurons, then what does a neuron do? Why does that matter? Teleology: do neurons have goals??? Etiology: Are they reacting to causes??? My answer might surprise you: sort of both! HUH!?
