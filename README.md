# (America First, Follow the leader of the free world)
Isn't it nice that all our voices are heard under the 1rst Amendment?
My old (side page icon) was too negative for my liking. While thought provoking, I've decided it was a bit distasteful. I have a new icon in the works. One quite inclusive of all voices :)
I am of the immovable opinion that America is the Best Country on Earth.

One of the reasons I made this was becasue I'm so fucking tired of being called a narcissist. No more scapegoats. We need to try to understand eachother. It's fine if we don't, no of us are "bad" for it. Trying to understand is the ONLY thing that matters. Accepting the we don't understand is the key, but trying to understand is the gate.

# ‚úçÔ∏è Authorship & AI Collaboration Disclosure

Author: Charles‚ÄØD.‚ÄØMiller‚ÄØV

I am the sole author and originator of the ideas, narrative structure, and creative expression in Recursive Simplicity: End the Nightmare. All synthesis, metaphor frameworks, and conceptual models are the result of my direct engagement with cited sources, my lived experience as a Complex PTSD survivor, and my own analysis.

In developing this work:

I'm Personally reading and reviewing all sources listed in the References.

I Formulated original interpretations and integrated concepts into my own language and structure.

I Designed thematic and metaphorical frameworks to convey complex ideas with clarity and accessibility.

I received editorial and technical assistance limited to:

Formatting citations in APA style and ensuring consistent referencing.

Identifying opportunities to increase neurodiverse accessibility and trauma‚Äëinformed pacing.

Providing mechanical feedback on structure, clarity, and consistency.

No third‚Äëparty contributor or AI system determined the substance, sequence, or argumentation of this book. All such elements are my original intellectual work. Any assistance functioned in an advisory or editorial capacity, comparable to that of a proofreader or accessibility consultant. This repository is currently under reconstruction for ethics and clarity. The model (PSIM(I)) is conceptual and not a clinical protocol. Copilot AI helped me replace the discrete sum of parts cognitive bias to the utility score formula in the PSIM(I) engine. The rest was hybridized from blood, sweat, and contradiction induction.
