Etiology or Teleology?
I first learned about the existence of etiology and teleology from The Courage to be Disliked, by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga. The sharp contradiction between etiology and teleology, as they explained it, poured over me like ice-cold water in the middle of deep sleep, especially after having read Complex PTSD by Pete Walker so recently. Let’s break down these terms, as they appear quite often in numerous other self-help books. They’re foundational:
Etiology – Greek Root: aitia, which means “cause, responsibility.” The study of causes. The origin. 
Teleology – Greek Root: telos, which means “goal, result.” The study of goals. The end. 
	Do you see how tricky it can be to pick either etiology or teleology as a lens? Are there only causes? Are there only goals? Disorienting, really. So, I had to take a step back and think. To literally think about thinking. Funny right? But seriously, where does thinking, feeling, and doing happen? 
Simple: the brain. My brain. Your brain. Their brain. There’s this guy named Peter Putnam who made this Outline of a Functional Model of the Nervous System in 1963. A very academic hoity-toity piece of work for sure, but he says that the brain is sort of a bunch of correlated neurons.  I want you to remember that this book serves as a simplification of the complicated. As much as people love and/or hate their brain, that’s where the thinking, feeling, and doing originate. To see the big end goal of the brain – the teleological end – we kinda have to see where the brain originates – the etiological origin from the perspective of a neuron. 
If the brain is made of a bunch of neurons, then what does a neuron do? Why does that matter? Teleology: do neurons have goals??? Etiology: Are they reacting to causes??? Neurons don’t have brains themselves, so why even ask these outlandish questions? My answer might surprise you: it kinda looks like neurons have a singular goal! HUH!? The closest word I could make up for a metaphor that encapsulates a neuron would be: they HAVE a goal-cause and they ARE a goal-cause. 


The seed to freedom’s been planted to support our goal-causes. Let’s see if we can breach through the dissonance, contradiction, and confusion, together. I want to see if there’s a bottom to all of this. Let’s dive in.
