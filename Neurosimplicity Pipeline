Flow Chart: The Neurosimplicity “Cure” Pipeline

[ Individual has Existence Goal ]
                |
                v
[ Encounter Stressors & Innate Biases ]
   • Negative Bias ("This must be bad!")
   • Positive Bias ("This must be good!")
                |
                v
[ Trauma Imprint & Adaptive Loop Hijack ]
   • hyper-Pause (Dissociative Freeze)
   • hyper-scan (Threat Scan)
   • maladaptive Interfere (Avoidance, Numbing, Narcissistic Safety-Seeking, Mis-directed Blame)
   • runaway Influence (Fawning Fear Behaviors, social maintenance)
                |
                v
[ Teleology Gap: Loss of “Why” ]
                |
                v
[ Phase 1: Neurosimplicity Closes Gap(PSIM(I)) ]
   • Pause → grounding scripts, inhibitory  
   • Scan → neutral threat drills, excitatory  
   • Influence → habit-stack rebuilds, excitatory
   • Modify → active reframes & catharsis, excitatory
   • Calibrate Stress Spectrum (Huberman)  
   • Harness Main Neuroplasticity Components (Huberman)
   • NeuroSimplicity Supplement Matrix (PSIMI Engine Accelerator)
                |
                v
[ Phase 2: Dual Sympathetic Reset (DSR) ]
   • Stella’s Stellate Ganglion Blocks (C6 & C4)  
   • Pre-/Post-Reset PSIM(I) loop awareness  
                |
                v
[ Phase 3: EMDR Integration ]
   • Bilateral stimulation reprocessing  
   • Sequenced after Phases 1 & 2 becuase the memories shouldn't retraumatize at this point  
   • Self-administered EMDR tools
                |
                v
[ Cultivating Courage via Nested Dialectics ]
   • Self ↔ Other | Parent ↔ Child | Master ↔ Slave  
   • “Assert what needs to be asserted” (Kishimi/Koga)
                |
                v
[ Daily Neuro-Micro Exercises & Toolkit ]
   • Grounding Scripts, Reframing Prompts, Journals  
   • Supplement & Sensory Modulation
                |
                v
[ Outcome: Rewired Loops, Renewed Purpose & Resilient Emergent Self ]
                |
                v
[ Empowered Parallel Processing ]
   • Freely harness both positive and negative bias  
     in real time for adaptive, balanced responses
