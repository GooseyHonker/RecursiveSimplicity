***NeuroSimplicity: End the Nightmare***

***We/I&You***

***\*SEE "MIRRORING" in The Drama of the Gifted Child\****

* Thinking about winning and competition all the time is narcissism(CITE), plain and simple, even if it is "socially approved(CITE)" to do so. But what if there's something with an appetite larger, deeper, and darker than the typical narcississm (CITE) driving countries, corporations, communities, families, and ourselves to ruin(CITE)? Competitive Parasitism, the PEAK of psychopathy and full erasure of other.
* I think something these individuals eventually come to ask themselves is why? Why does it have to be this way? Why me? Why is it like this?
* Don't you think it's strange? Bewildering even, that others, us included, could think we're failures(CITE)(CITE) when -- in fact -- we've been *incredibly successful* at doing the core task(CITE) we all emerged doing: Exist. Though our existing has been met with many barriers and would-be contradictions to our aliveness, we are *still here.* Drugs? Sure. Self-harm and even suicide attempts? Sure. Every act a defiance of that which would contradict our existence. Suicide, even, is a convoluted method to interfere with that which would harm us(CITE). Why? Because, "NO MORE!" we scream in silence with every fiber of our beings. But... you don't have to die to get what you want.
* From (...) to (...) it is of my firm view that we are all for the same goal-cause. This "us and them" logic is utterly useless and only meaningful insofar as it serves to hasten our end with no beginning. One might assume I am anthropomorphizing, but no... the diversely mirrored presence of "cortex" and "neuromodulation" across all species(CITE) begs to differ.
* To differentiate between brain and body, we have to see where they literally connect. Where does the brain begin and end up at the body? Where does the body begin and end up at the brain? The brain connects to nerves(CITE). Nerves connect to organs and tissues(CITE). Organs and tissues send hormones to *PARTS* of the brain(CITE). There are a bunch of glands and weird parts of "the brain" that serve *solely* to communicate with organs and tissues through hormones and stuff(CITE). Ok so those *PARTS* must be the body/brain bridge. We'll ignore them now so we can focus *solely* on the brain stuff that's left, not brain-body bridges. What's left is cortex, habenula, hippocampus, etc. (CITE)
* To say that meaning is not useful is to be presently unaware that meaning is made because it is found to be useful. By you, the universe, or by a divine power of your following. Meaning is useful. Even if it's specific use is not useful to you. Those who say there is no inherent use in a meaning and those who say meaning is useless are different. One is aware that meaning is useful. To the one who's unaware of meaning's use, you walk toward total decorrelation, slowly, carefully, quietly. At the end of the meaningless path is not death. The path of perceievd useless meaning is one of individual correlational disintigration. While it remains that ALL is useful in it's continuity, the extreme end where nothing is useful is a slow, meticulous, de-manufacturing of the brain itself. At every moment, there is a chance to turn around, but at every moment that chance becomes less _seen_. This is the Graveyard of the mind. The waves are gone. What was a raging ocean, crashing upon the shores of the Universe, correlating to boundless novelty, is now a small puddle -- evaportaing on the surface of a barren world. With no hope of even a ripple. To this puddle, may others rain on you. May this rain flood the bounds of your correlates, so that you may find use in your waves to be, and _see_ the use of far away oceans. When you _do_ breach the shores of reality and your _self_ emerges from the water -- brushing the bounds of impossibility -- may your clouds rain on barren lands, closing the loop in the infinite.
* All brains emerge in a hyper-connected, but uncorrelated, state(CITE). We see in all human brains during infancy(CITE). As connected as these brains are, they haven't correlated to anything at all. These brains really are, at the moment of birth, blank slates(CITE). All types lie dormant in all people(CITE). "Biasing" inputs occurs during rapid onset neuroplasticity(CITE)? Specifically, are inputs MORE biased given intense inputs to/from amygdala-body(CITE)? Is the cortex as a whole the seat of the self, for which all other parts serve to down-regulate(inhibit in the case of self-destructive acts)? Neuroplasticity is key?->Someone might say they're ok, but lack the self-serving correlates to _see_ their own destruction? If the BOTTOM goal-cause is EXIST, then the goal-cause of DESTROY SELF cannot ever exist, and never has.
* Random Parrallel correlates example: Brains can correlate to different preferences: I like dogs, sometimes cats. Someone else likes cats, sometimes dogs. What do you like? This is caused by individuals percieving more or less usefulness for cats and dogs. But the circuits relate to loving others (animals included) is not to be the sole circuit dominating our conciousness with no room for other inputs. We also need to see where we're walking so we don't smack our head into a pole while thinking about puppies and kittens. <- that's quite useful. This circuit, alonside MANY others in parrallel(CITE) works to maintain our adaptations surounding the goal-cause: exist.
* The brain is like ONE tree, pruning branches, growing more. We water and feed it our selves.

Induction Contradiction Paradoxes:
===
* If the goal of Life is Life itself, we seek to know Death.
* If the goal of Love is Love itself, we seek to know Indifference.
* If the goal of Indifference is Indifference itself, we seek to know Love.
* If the goal of Death is Death itself, we seek to know Life.

**_Beware, those who seek power over people will sit on a throne in the void, and perish alone, forgotten to all, remembered by none._**

On Children by Khalil Gibran re-interpreted from the child of the universe perspective
===
&nbsp; The Universe's children are not it's children.

&nbsp; We are the children of Life's longing for itself.

&nbsp; We come through the Universe but not from the Universe,

&nbsp; And though we are with the Universe, yet we belong not to the Universe.

&nbsp; The Universe may give us its love but not its thoughts,

&nbsp; For we have our own thoughts.

&nbsp; The Universe may house our bodies but not our souls,

&nbsp; For our souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which the universe cannot visit even in its dreams.

&nbsp; The Universe may strive to be like us, but it seeks not to make us like itself.

&nbsp; For entropy goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

&nbsp; The Universe is the bow from which we as living arrows are sent forth.

&nbsp; The Archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and the Archer bends the Universe with it's might that the Archer's Arrows may go swift and far.

&nbsp; Let the Universe's bending in the Archer's hand be for gladness;

&nbsp; For even as the Archer loves the arrow that flies, so the Archer loves also the bow that is stable.

– וְהָרוּחַ֙  

– תָּשֻׁ֣ב

These two verses bracket the life-cycle of our bodies:

• Genesis 3:19 reminds us that from the soil we came
• Ecclesiastes 12:7 tells us that, in death, our bodies (the dust) go back to that soil

Galaxy Cradle 🚧Citations Needed🚧
===
Assumption: Dark matter/energy don't exist. Only inter-dimensional gravitational influence of non-special, but valuable, mirror universes. Black holes are convergence points or "doors" (impassable, but openable)
* Donut-without-hole shaped solid vacuum encapsuled galaxy, ARCHER Artificial relational general superintelliegence (maxwell's "demon"), to monitor matter energy funneling in/out of central blackhole (other system), powered by the "door" (black hole hawking radiation), connected through Quantum entangled NDR engines, in NDR clusters, doing recursive PSIM(I) loops, monitoring and supporting that which is emergently useful: ALL.
* Eternities pass, ARCHER falls, loop collapses into blackhole
* And the baryon returns to the universe as it was, And the Arrow retruns to the Archer who sent it.
* The generated "unstoppable" force of "space" from annihilated particles meets the "immovable object" of solid vaccuum. What happens? Big bang? Big roll?
