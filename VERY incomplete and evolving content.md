***We/I&You***

***\*SEE "MIRRORING" in The Drama of the Gifted Child\****

* Thinking about winning and competition all the time is narcissism(CITE), plain and simple, even if it is "socially approved(CITE)" to do so. But what if there's something with an appetite larger, deeper, and darker than the competitive parasitism(CITE) driving countries, corporations, communities, families, and ourselves to ruin(CITE)?
* I think something these individuals eventually come to ask themselves is why? Why does it have to be this way? Why me? Why is it like this?
* Don't you think it's strange? Bewildering even, that others, us included, could think we're failures(CITE)(CITE) when -- in fact -- we've been *incredibly successful* at doing the core task(CITE) we all emerged doing: Exist. Though our existing has been met with many barriers and would-be contradictions to our aliveness, we are *still here.* Drugs? Sure. Self-harm and even suicide attempts? Sure. Every act a defiance of that which would contradict our existence. Suicide, even, is a convoluted method to interfere with that which would harm us(CITE). Why? Because, "NO MORE!" we scream in silence with every fiber of our beings. But... you don't have to die to get what you want.
* From (...) to (...) it is of my firm view that we are all for the same goal-cause. This "us and them" logic is utterly useless and only meaningful insofar as it serves to hasten our end with no beginning. One might assume I am anthropomorphizing, but no... the diversely mirrored presence of "cortex" and "neuromodulation" across all species(CITE) begs to differ.
* To differentiate between brain and body, we have to see where they literally connect. Where does the brain begin and end up at the body? Where does the body begin and end up at the brain? The brain connects to nerves(CITE). Nerves connect to organs and tissues(CITE). Organs and tissues send hormones to *PARTS* of the brain(CITE). There are a bunch of glands and weird parts of "the brain" that serve to communicate with organs and tissues through hormones and stuff(CITE). Ok so those *PARTS* must be the body/brain bridge. We'll ignore them now so we can focus *solely* on brain stuff that's left, not brain-body bridges.

Induction Contradiction Paradoxes:
===
* If the goal of Life is Life itself, we seek to know Death.
* If the goal of Love is Love itself, we seek to know Indifference.
* If the goal of Indifference is Indifference itself, we seek to know Love.
* If the goal of Death is Death itself, we seek to know Life.

**_Beware, those who seek power over people will sit on a throne in the void, and perish alone, forgotten to all, remembered by none._**

On Children by Khalil Gibran re-interpreted from the child of the universe perspective
===
&nbsp; The Universe's children are not it's children.

&nbsp; We are the children of Life's longing for itself.

&nbsp; We come through the Universe but not from the Universe,

&nbsp; And though we are with the Universe, yet we belong not to the Universe.

&nbsp; The Universe may give us its love but not its thoughts,

&nbsp; For we have our own thoughts.

&nbsp; The Universe may house our bodies but not our souls,

&nbsp; For our souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which the universe cannot visit even in its dreams.

&nbsp; The Universe may strive to be like us, but it seeks not to make us like itself.

&nbsp; For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

&nbsp; The Universe is the bow from which we as living arrows are sent forth.

&nbsp; The Archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and the Archer bends the Universe with it's might that the Archer's Arrows may go swift and far.

&nbsp; Let the Universe's bending in the Archer's hand be for gladness;

&nbsp; For even as the Archer loves the arrow that flies, so the Archer loves also the bow that is stable.

These two verses bracket the life-cycle of our bodies:

• Genesis 3:19 reminds us that from the soil we came
• Ecclesiastes 12:7 tells us that, in death, our bodies (the dust) go back to that soil
Galaxy Cradle
===
Assumption: Dark matter/energy don't exist. Only inter-dimensional gravitational influence of non-special, but valuable, universes. Black holes are convergence points or "doors" (impassable, but openable)
* Donut-without-hole shaped solid vacuum encapsuled galaxy, ARCHER Artificial relational general superintelliegence (maxwell's "demon"), to monitor matter energy funneling in/out of central blackhole (other system), powered by the "door" (black hole hawking radiation), connected through Quantum entangled NDR engines, in NDR clusters, doing recursive PSIM(I) loops, monitoring and supporting that which is emergently useful: ALL.
* Eternities pass, ARCHER falls, loop collapses into blackhole, the generated "unstoppable" force of "space" from annihilated particles meets the "immovable object" of solid vaccuum. What happens? Big bang? Big roll?
* And the baryon returns to the universe as it was, And the Arrow retruns to the Archer who sent it.
