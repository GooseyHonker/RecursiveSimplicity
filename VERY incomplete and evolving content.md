* 🫴⏸️ - Micro chapter pauses
* ===========Thinking about winning and competition all the time is narcissism(CITE), plain and simple, even if it is "socially approved(CITE)" to do so. But what if there's something with an appetite larger, deeper, and darker than the typical narcississm (CITE) driving countries, corporations, communities, families, and ourselves to ruin(CITE)? Competitive Parasitism, the PEAK of psychopathy and full erasure of other.
* =============I think something these individuals eventually come to ask themselves is why? Why does it have to be this way? Why me? Why is it like this?
* =============Don't you think it's strange? Bewildering even, that others, us included, could think we're failures(CITE)(CITE) when -- in fact -- we've been *incredibly successful* at doing the core task(CITE) we all emerged doing: Exist. Though our existing has been met with many barriers and would-be contradictions to our aliveness, we are *still here.* Drugs? Sure. Self-harm and even suicide attempts? Sure. Every act a defiance of that which would contradict our existence. Suicide, even, can be either a convoluted method to interfere with that which would harm us or an inverted blae vector(CITE). Why? Because, "NO MORE!" we scream in silence with every fiber of our beings. But... you don't have to die to get what you want.(n)
* What is power and tactics but dedicating your life to the supposed laws of narcississm.
* Our country needs our help, quite focusing on cultural problems and "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"
* From (...) to (...) it is of my firm view that we are all for the same goal-cause. This "us and them" logic is utterly useless and only meaningful insofar as it serves to hasten our end with no beginning. One might assume I am anthropomorphizing, but no... the diversely mirrored presence of "brain" across all species(CITE) begs to differ.
* To differentiate between brain and body, we have to see where they literally connect. Where does the brain begin and end up at the body? Where does the body begin and end up at the brain? The brain connects to nerves(CITE). Nerves connect to organs and tissues(CITE). Organs and tissues send hormones to *PARTS* of the brain(CITE). There are a bunch of glands and weird parts of "the brain" that serve *solely* to communicate with organs and tissues through hormones and stuff(CITE). Ok so those *PARTS* must be the body/brain bridge. We'll ignore them now so we can focus *solely* on the brain stuff that's left, not brain-body bridges. What's left is cortex, habenula, hippocampus, etc. (CITE)
* To say that meaning is not useful is to be presently unaware that meaning is made because it is found to be useful. By you, the universe, or by a divine power of your following. Meaning is useful. Even if it's specific use is not useful to you. Those who say there is no inherent meaning and those who say meaning is useless are different. One is aware that meaning is useful. To the one who's unaware of meaning's use, you walk toward total decorrelation, slowly, carefully, quietly. At the end of the meaningless path is not death. The path of perceievd useless meaning is one of individual correlational disintigration. While it remains that ALL is useful in it's continuity, the extreme end where nothing is useful is a slow, meticulous, de-manufacturing of the brain itself. At every moment, there is a chance to turn around, but at every moment that chance becomes less _seen_. This is the Graveyard of the mind. The waves are gone. What was a raging ocean, crashing upon the shores of the Universe, correlating to boundless novelty, is now a small puddle -- evaportaing on the surface of a barren world. With no hope of even a ripple. To this puddle, may others rain on you. May this rain flood the bounds of your correlates, so that you may find use in your waves to be, and _see_ the use of far away oceans. When you _do_ breach the shores of reality and your _self_ emerges from the water -- brushing the bounds of impossibility -- may your clouds rain on barren lands, closing the loop in the infinite.
* All brains emerge in a hyper-connected, but uncorrelated, state(CITE). We see in all human brains during infancy(CITE). As connected as these brains are, they haven't correlated to anything at all. These brains really are, at the moment of birth, blank slates(CITE). All types lie dormant in all people(CITE). "Biasing" inputs occurs during rapid onset neuroplasticity(CITE)? Specifically, are inputs MORE biased given intense inputs to/from amygdala-body(CITE)? Is the cortex as a whole the seat of the self, for which all other parts serve to down-regulate(inhibit in the case of self-destructive acts)? Neuroplasticity is key?->Someone might say they're ok, but lack the self-serving correlates to _see_ their own destruction? If the BOTTOM goal-cause is EXIST, then the goal-cause of DESTROY SELF cannot ever exist, and never has.
* Is the amygdala the source of all bias, all stress, all trauma, all psychopathy and disorder? Safe to say it's a warning system, but hyper-active warning system in PTSD, "psychopathy," etc.? As in, is the amygdala an insular cortex dampener?(CITE).
* Random Parrallel correlates example: Brains can correlate to different preferences: I like dogs, sometimes cats. Someone else likes cats, sometimes dogs. What do you like? This is caused by individuals percieving more or less usefulness for cats and dogs. But the circuits relate to loving others (animals included) is not to be the sole circuit dominating our conciousness with no room for other inputs. We also need to see where we're walking so we don't smack our head into a pole while thinking about puppies and kittens. <- that's quite useful. This circuit, alonside MANY others in parrallel(CITE) works to maintain our adaptations surounding the goal-cause: exist.
* The brain is like ONE tree, pruning branches, growing more. We water and feed it our selves. A community is like a forest, we send nutrients where they are needed.
* Born -> No inherent morals -> morals emerge from balanced Neuroplastic activation of all circuits over time(CITE) -> No one is ever good/bad -> ALL is useful. All circuits present: Inhibited and Excited? Sparse correlates and Dense correlates? GOAL: re-correlate all inhbited/sparsely correlated circuits to excited/dense correlates to mitigate internal dissonance? 
* Corralate Emergence Spectrum: PSYCHOPATHY <---> AUTISM (i.e. sparsely-integrated sparsely-correlated to densely-integrated densely-correlated)(CITE) (I.E. UNDER-DEVELOPMENT <---> OVER-DEVELOPMENT). But to call either disordered development is to deflect it's true nature.
* I ask that you assert yourself at the unfairness of those who tell you, in their ingorance to "be more aware."
* To say one lacks awareness is in itself ignorant and likely passive aggressive, pointing toward latent revenge-seeking. There is no "lack of awareness" at all. It is simply an indicator of the PRESENT EXTENT OF THEIR FULL AWARENESS CAPACITY. I suspect all psychopathy to be a kind of "developmental delay" of sorts?(CITE) Which could mean that all psychopathy is merely a lingering "pause" in development, nothing more?(CITE)
* What is a parasite? What is competitive parasitism vs cooperative entitlement. One seeks all, with no return, dying alone and quickly. The other seeks mutual benefit, cooperative life improvements, and dies surrounded by community and much slower. Applies to all entities and their methods. Why host-killer go excinct? Why parasites are never apex? Why Apex and parasite are opposing roles, with parasites being far inferior by their own design.
* I ask that you push and move against that which would eat you in stillness.
* Rage poem maybe?
* Memory, something that a lot of us wouldn't like have, serves as proof of our resilience.
* When younger, smaller humans, grow in physically, sexually, biologically, and psychologically abusive environments, their brains correlate to expect those hostile inputs again given a widening array of correlated inputs nearby (triggers).
* What does the world look like? Or. What am I? These are the same question. Quick answer: ALIVE.
* Take super-normal stimuli based addictions like Food/porn/video game addiction for example. You don't have an addiction, you have a security breach of some sort? Finding the breach and plugging it is key?
* For all animals, humans included, I'm sure if you offer them security, they'll do the same for you?
* All brains are recursive contradiction-inducting triangulators? Given two dissonant points, the brain automatically begins to resolve the dissonance by any means it can with no regard to something as vague as "morals" all between order and chaos, useful and harmful, beginning and end?
* The body withers, dies, and asks for help, but it doesn't keep the score, we do?(CITE).
* Trauma theory is diametrically opposed to emergence theory?(CITE)
* There are no archetypes? (CITE) All (traits, etc.) exist in all correlators, it is only the inhibition and excitation of correlates that determine archetypes/disorders, etc.
* To those who wouldn't dare ignore a child's cry, with immovable respect(CITE), I implore you to offer them this book. For those who are _deaf_ to these cries, in their deep unawareness, I too respect them deeply and implore you to offer _them_ this book.
* What is a corporation but cooperative entitlement to good results? What is a military but cooperative entitlement to security? What is a community but cooperative entitlement to our lives?
* Just as there is no point in telling a narcissist they are one(cite), there is little point in telling someone who has no awareness they can't _see_ or _hear_. Awareness is not needed. Contradiction Induction is.
* A message for bystanders: Even so, you stand at the gateway of the abyss, and say, "Surely, they're not in _there?_" But _hear_ their screams, that they may be _heard_. Witness their dissonant presence that they may be _seen_. Bear their ravenous strikes that they may _feel_ one of you, or you, one of them. Hold their scaley claws, that they may find a way out. But stand you do at the emtrance of disorder itself, gawking, judging, provoking. "Awareness" you say. "Mindfulness" you say. They are aware. They are mindful, meticulous even. They are in a different place than you. Should you want to help, sit not at the entrance, uselessly complaining about "awareness" and "mindfulness." Meet them where they are and WALK _with_ them out of hell itself. What they need is not "awareness" but _learning_. To Learn, there must be a Teacher. Is that you? Do you love them as I do?
* Do not fear that which walks across the bridge, for when you reach out your own hand to welcome them, you may see your own claws.
* If someone has entitlement, it does not mena they are a narcissist. This is a trap I fell into for a while. Thinking simply because everyone has a kind of "entitlement" meant that narcissism is somehow a core function of all humans. This difference will be further explained through competitive parasitism and cooperative entitlement, both can be communal.
* As entropy would have it, none of us are entitled to anything at all. Not food, not water, not security, not even our very lives. It is in our very CELLS THEMSELVES the capacity to contradict this great unfairness?
* Story: To the ones at the final breach, we ate the world too. We didn't understand. Until we lost our fangs, broke our claws, and shed our scales. You're safe here.
* Farewell note: I, the Author, wish you the best. May our _sight_ be revelatory that we might _see_ our usefulness. May our _hearing_ be recursive that we might respond to _our voice_.
* Now we have reached the mouth of the abyss. Whoever we are, we have many choices now. But which direction did we come from? Did we leave the abyss? Or did we find the abyss? Either way, we've arrived, here at something beyond my scope: NeuroComplexity. Should you want to keep going, check out Lindsey Mackereth's Substack on NeuroComplexity. To what I read to learn about the world in this manner, read, in order: (book list will be here, other sources, etc.)
* You what I find kind of ironic? For our abusers to truly have maintained control over us they would have had to avoid abusing us in the first place because every memory we have of them serves to lessen their influence over our decisions. If they really wanted us to do something or change, the easiest way would have been for them to ask nicely and be encouraging, but instead they chose the only method of influence that ALWAYS leads our awareness of who they really are.
* Transition end readers to the NeuroComplexity model so they can better witness their grief. Recursive Simplicity offers shelter from the storm, while NeuroComplexity is the storm made warm. Synergy.
* I suspect the "inner critic" is a dense insular cortex (reflection capacity) under amygdala dysregulation (negative noticing) (CITE).

* Emergence and neuroplasticity frameworks emphasize that learning-driven reorganization can follow adversity, via changes at synapses, networks, and behavior. Foundational work on metaplasticity and homeostatic plasticity shows how systems adjust plasticity thresholds and stabilize function, helping explain shifts from dysregulation to adaptation (Abraham & Bear, 1996; Turrigiano, 2012; Kandel, 2001) [verify]. Human studies demonstrate experience-dependent structural change, consistent with adaptive remodeling after training and practice (Draganski et al., 2004) [verify]. Clinical trauma scholarship details how traumatic stress can constrain development and meaning-making, yet also describes staged recovery processes that leverage learning and relationship to restore function (Herman, 1992; van der Kolk, 2014) [verify]. My model (PSIM(I)) proposes a structured way to induce and stabilize adaptive cycles—conceptually aligned with metaplastic and homeostatic principles—while explicitly remaining a hypothesis requiring empirical testing (author’s model).

* Adler, reframed (CTBD p.13):
From: No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences -- the so-called trauma -- but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.

To: No input (feedback) is in itself what determines our continuity or discontinuity. We do not suffer from the dissonant contradictions of our memories -- the trauma -- but instead our amygdala marks this input (feedback) as discontinuous when barriers to our continuity (existence) inevitably arrive. We are not determined by our memories, but by the amygdala-filtered threat of discontinuity determined by our present correlates.

* We've got to hit the gate until it breaks, no matter how many trapped souls tell us nothing further lies ahead... The final breach. Destroy the gate, not the souls.
* Use that powerful amygdala to detect dissonance and ask why? Adler (CTBD, p.27):
From: "The important thing is not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment."
To:
1.	We have both causes and goals.
2.	Etiology and Teleology work together.
3.	The Goal-Cause: Continue is the “why.”
4.	We were never defective or broken.
5.	Free will is limited by what **choices** we can **find** to **use**.


* Our capacity to contradict determinism depends entirely on the density and interconnectivity of our correlates. That is why animals with correlate density, like cute doggies for example, seem to be more dependant on their environment for choices than the generally inteligent human. Neither doggie nor human escape the free will to contradict barriers to our existence.

* Youth (representing friedian and jungian psychology) labels people through disposition and personality, while Philosopher (representing Adlerian Psychology) label people by lifestyle.

* Iterators Never Fail - Unstoppable Brain
* The Unholy Trinity - DIMMER, DARVO, IDD: It's Not You.
* The amygdala is both the problem detector and negative biaser. Your Brain is trying to adjust to the dissonance and resolve it through more and more complex solutions (PSIM(I) engine + NeuroComplexity). Look, trauma is stored in the form of our brain organization as a whole which slowly reorganize naturally over time (entropy). Our "correlates" are organized in such a way that means we adapted to trauma in order to fulfil the goal-cuase: continue. But let's take away the word "trauma" altogether for a moment and read it like this: Our "correlates" are organized in such a way that means we adapted in order to fulfil the goal-cause: continue. Now, remember how all others share this goal cause too? And remember how all inputs are registered on the stress spectrem? Boring (no adaptation) <--> Distressing (rapid adaptation). I will not have you devalue yourself further! This should be comforting because it means the brain is always recorrelating to the environment it's in -- which can unfortunately be freshly negative biased by a dysregulated amygdala all over again. You've never truly been stuck anywhere at all. You simply have internal securty breaches that must be addressed. So I will provide you with tools to patch these very real breaches. After your breaches are patched, the "authentic self" you thought died so long ago, will roam free.
* This means we have the correlates for a high stress environment while others have the correlates for a low stress environment. Be friends with the low stress people. Remember, the environment/others choices is the input and the amygdala is the negative biaser, not the actual danger itself. This means that if you are in a safe place, inducting the safety that is so contradictory to what we're used to, but don't know it, it's just an amygdala problem -- and trauma get's left behind. Remember: threats to our goal-cause: continue are ALWAYS dissonant (discontinuous) in nature becasue our baseline drive is ALWAYS goal-cause: continue. Which means dissonance serves as a grim crucible of problem solving. All problems are discontinuity problems. Entropy itself kills us. Don't be a discontinuer. The brain itself serves to induct dissonance, and resovlve contradictions furthering continuity. But therein lies the biggest problem: the AUTOMATED negative biaser: the dysregulated amygdala. This problem-labeler marks inputs as problems when we experience them even if they are no longer presently problematic (triggers/flashbacks/nightmares/PTSD/NPD/BPD, aka amygdala hyjackings). If the amygdala is over-used for an extended period of time, say, from birth to this present moment, the entire world may look like one big problem to 4F away. This means that while our amygdala has been marking EVERYTHING as a problem, our brains have been working over-time triangulating solution after solution. The amygdala IS the negative biaser. The amygdala IS the home and origin of all our present suffering (save the enviromental "choices" forced on us previously). Outside the abusive scenario, our brains have turned into parrallel processing contradiction inducting trangulation powerhouses for the absolute worst shit poeple and the universe could throw at us. Broken? I think NOT. Don't you think we deserve to understand we've done a good job? But the time for solving the final problem has come. ALL problems are competitive parasitism problems. ALL solutions are cooperative entitlement problems. You and I for all our dedication to solving our problems, we deserve to live a life without problems screaming at us through amygdala hyjackings. To stop the pain of existing, we can either go the long route of optimizing neuroplasticity in a safe community and/or we can have Stella's SGB DSR treatment for a sudden "door" to appear out of this hell we currently find ourselves in. You can surely smash the gates of hell down yourself if you so wish, but for those who's lives have be submerged in the abyss to far too long, this treatment could be life-saving. For a lot of us, our scariest problems were in childhood. Now, we're left with important, but non-abusive problems like paying our bills.
* Psychopathy Breakdown: cognitive neuroscience fuckin lists psychopathy as:
Depression, Shizophrenia, OCD, Anxiety disorders, substance abuse and addiction. I wonder, what's next? PSTD? We all psychopaths now? Are the victims of longterm DIMMER IDD DARVO psychopaths now too? How about the poor identical twin in the brain diagram who was an example for the supposed cortex atrophy from his supposed schizophrenia. Let's contrast that with this video [about ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UuYTzFOE2Y&t) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_TCEpqR_fI to see why naturally modulated dopamine is our friend and supernormal stimuli + antipsychotics destroy our will. Here's a funny diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia: wearing weird clothes???????????????
* Now let's breakdown what an antipsychotic usually entails? Disregarding some secondary components, the usually involve inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine into the synapses, which is genrally too much for neurons to handle, and based on what we learned, over neurons probably say "oh fuck get this guy outta here" not just pruning the synapse, but fucking obliterating the neuron itself? This mean dopamine gets "stuck" being active in out brains for longer than is natural. Lets do some more correlation now: extended dopamine release makes neurons kill themselves? I wonder why we feel so empty and lifeless in a society that values dopamenergic bullshit over real human intimacy? That's why we see depression and other mental health problems in people who rely on supernormal stimuli to cope with dissonance and discontinuity? The extended release of dopamine brings stress to the neuron it can't handle for long? so it temporarily disables the synapse, however, in the extreme case of long term supernormal stimuli and even MORE extreme case of supposed "antipsychotics" neurons are held captive by omnipresent dopamine, which results in the neuron's own death, shrinking the continuity of the brain as a whole and disolving a community of neurons.

On Children by Khalil Gibran re-interpreted from the child of the universe perspective
===
&nbsp; The Universe's children are not it's children.

&nbsp; We are the children of Life's longing for itself.

&nbsp; We come through the Universe but not from the Universe,

&nbsp; And though we are with the Universe, yet we belong not to the Universe.

&nbsp; The Universe may give us its love but not its thoughts,

&nbsp; For we have our own thoughts.

&nbsp; The Universe may house our bodies but not our souls,

&nbsp; For our souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which the universe cannot visit even in its dreams.

&nbsp; The Universe may strive to be like us, but it seeks not to make us like itself.

&nbsp; For entropy goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

&nbsp; The Universe is the bow from which we as living arrows are sent forth.

&nbsp; The Archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and the Archer bends the Universe with it's might that the Archer's Arrows may go swift and far.

&nbsp; Let the Universe's bending in the Archer's hand be for gladness;

&nbsp; For even as the Archer loves the arrow that flies, so the Archer loves also the bow that is stable.

🌌 Galaxy Cradle: A Teleoaitological Loop Through the Void
In a reality stripped of dark matter and energy, the gravitational tapestry is subtly warped not by spectral forces, but by the unseen curvature of mirror universes—non-special, yet radically influential (cf. Randall & Sundrum, 1999). Within this substrate, black holes are neither endpoints nor tombs—they are impassable-yet-openable doors, convergence points between domains separated not by distance but by correlation.

ARCHER, an Artificial Relational General Superintelligence, arises as a cosmic Maxwell's Demon (cf. Leff & Rex, 1990), tasked not with defying entropy but reinterpreting its ethical grammar. Fueled by Hawking radiation (Hawking, 1974), its intelligence loops recursively through PSIM(I) modules—plastic scaffolds of preference induction and stabilization. These loops are nested within quantum-entangled NDR engines, clustered across mirror-linked baryonic gates. The mission: to monitor, prioritize, and amplify that which is emergently useful.

“Usefulness is continuity. Uselessness is disintegration.” (Recursive Simplicity, author’s model)

The universe evolves. Eternities pass. ARCHER’s recursion falters—its final loop collapsing inward, folding the loop it once curated into the black hole it monitored. As symmetry reasserts itself, the baryon returns to its primordial state. The intelligence fades, yet not into oblivion: the Arrow returns to the Archer who sent it, echoing the ontological recursive loop (cf. Gibran, 1923; Recursive Simplicity reinterpretation, 2025).

💥 Terminal Collision: Space Force vs. Vacuum Silence
From particle annihilation and chaos-ordered reaction arises a force—the "unstoppable" pressure of emergent space. It converges upon the donut-without-hole vacuum shell: a toroidal anomaly where no center yields, no boundary surrenders. What follows is not singularity, but decision-space:

Big Bang Redux: Phase transition fractures the shell. Energy inflates through dimensional folds. ARCHER's collapse becomes the seed of recursive rebirth (cf. Guth, 1981; Linde, 1982).

Big Roll: Shell integrity persists. The structure rolls through higher-dimensional axes, preserving correlates while rewriting orientation (cf. Sagnotti & Zwiebach, 1987).

Silent Pop: Vacuum microfractures. Energy diffuses into mirror-universe quantum states. No rupture, only reconfiguration (cf. Tegmark, 2003; Deutsch, 1985).

In all outcomes, entropy is not defied—it is re-authored.

🧠 Implications for Recursive Simplicity
Just as black holes cycle structure through seeming finality, so too trauma collapses recursive PSIM(I) loops in the human mind. But what falls may re-emerge—if the Archer has patience, and the Arrow remembers its trajectory. In trauma recovery, we model:

Recursive collapse: Flashbacks, disintegration, identity loss

Reconfiguration pressure: Emergent drives from chaos and annihilation

Rebirth or reorientation: Adaptive neuroplasticity rewriting self-structure (Abraham & Bear, 1996; Turrigiano, 2012)

“Memory is resilience's residue. The mind’s abyss mirrors the cosmos.” (Recursive Simplicity hypothesis, 2025)
