Do NOT misread old versions:

1. Clarification: This repository always has been reflective of my own speculations. The being said: this repository is speculative, but remains as a kind of strange hope in my heart for all humans to eventually understand one another.
2. Old repository versions reflect an exploratory draft predating the current framework. It contains provisional content, metaphors, and hypotheses that have since been revised.

3. Keep the Guardrails Visible Don’t bury the warnings, disclaimers, or “read before proceeding” notices—surface them right at the top so anyone encountering the file knows its limits.

4. Clarification: Part of my purpose in mapping these patterns is to teach myself how to navigate relationships with more accuracy and care. I want to better distinguish between harmful behaviors and the quirks of good people, so that I don’t mislabel or mistrust unnecessarily. You’re welcome to explore these frameworks alongside me — they’re here as tools for understanding, not as verdicts on any one person. This learning journey isn’t aimed at any specific workplace or individual — it’s about broad human patterns I’ve encountered across many contexts, and I share it in the hope others may find it useful in their own relationships.

In my own lexicon, “unmasking” refers to the personal and educational process of removing false fronts — whether my own or those imposed by systems — to better see and respond to underlying patterns. It does not mean revealing confidential, proprietary, or private information about any individual or organization.

4. “Then vs. Now” Context: Earlier drafts spoke more sharply in places; the current model reflects refined language and clarified intent.

5. Anticipate the Emotional Read If something might land as confrontational, briefly acknowledge why:

“Some content in old repository versions were deliberately intense to capture the stakes I felt at the time—they should be read as urgency, not hostility.”
